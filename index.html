			<p>Welcome to <strong>EditingMonth.org</strong>, an alternative to National Novel Editing Month. This site is <em>not</em> affiliated with National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo).</p>

			<h2>About</h2>
			<p>
				In 2024, the organization behind NaNoWriMo doubled down on its stance of allowing AI tools, claiming that condemning its use in the writing process "ignores classist and ableist" issues. This position has been lambasted by writers who've had to deal with real issues of having their work exploited by generative AI. It blurs the distinction between using technology to edit a novel and using tools like ChatGPT to ghostwrite a novel wholesale and claim it as original work.
			</p>
			<p>
				We love the concept of bypassing the inner critic by writing a novel in a month. But we hate the direction the organization is taking, and want to do better.
			</p>
			<p>This website was created to be part of a decentralized writing community to help authors find critique partners and groups to edit their novel without needing to rely on generative AI tools, personal connections in the publishing industry, or the money to hire a professional editor.
